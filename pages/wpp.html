            <p><i>2025 - Figma.</i></p>

            <p> As part of an information architecture and mockup exercise, I developed a prototype for the World Press Photo mobile application with the goal of creating an intuitive, accessible, and efficient user experience. The design focuses on simplifying navigation and organizing content effectively, based on a flowchart developed in earlier stages of the project. This structure was informed by prior user research, including a card sorting activity conducted with relevant users to ensure alignment with their mental models. The result is a system that applies core principles of information architecture, enabling users to quickly access key sections such as their profile, visual exploration tools, and educational resources. I prioritized ease of use by incorporating familiar interface elements like a hamburger menu, bottom navigation bar, and shortcut access to frequently used features. Additionally, the prototype addresses the diverse needs of identified user personas by including functionality tailored to their interests, such as educational content, visual exploration, and account customization. Overall, this prototype represents a user-centered solution that supports clear information organization and fluid navigation, grounded in both research and design best practices.

                <p>The prototype we developed aims to provide an intuitive, accessible, and efficient user experience for the World Press Photo application. Focused on simplifying navigation and organization, we designed a content system based on the flowchart created in earlier activities, informed by a prior study using card sorting with relevant users.</p>

                <p>The project’s conceptualization began with an initial sketch that marked the first approach to the design. This sketch did not yet include the bottom navigation bar—later added with sections for Store, Explore, Customer Support, and Calendar—but it did show the first icon concepts for the bar in the lower-right corner. The bar was introduced to simplify the hamburger menu seen in the second screen. Based on this sketch, some menus were reordered and labels simplified to create a more intuitive experience. Additionally, profile access was placed in the upper-right corner to further streamline navigation.</p>

                <p> These screens show the “Information” section, accessed through the hamburger menu, which includes pages such as “About WPP” and “Accessibility.” Both subcategories share a similar design, a format that could be applied consistently across all hamburger menu subcategories. As noted earlier, the “Home” icon is still missing from the bottom navigation bar in this sketch.</p>

                <img src="../curr/ia/ia5.png" alt="Process 2">
                <p> These three screens show the “Education” section (accessed via the hamburger menu), the “Store” section (via the cart icon in the bottom bar), and the “Explore” section (accessed similarly). As before, the “Home” icon is still missing from the bottom bar. Otherwise, this concludes the first phase of project conceptualization, which—along with these notes—will serve as a reference for the next prototyping phase.</p>

                <p>They open the hamburger menu (three lines, top left).</p>
                <p>They select <strong>Information</strong>.</p>
                <p>They choose <strong>About WPP</strong>.</p>
                <p>The system redirects to the <strong>About WPP</strong> page with World Press Photo content.</p>
