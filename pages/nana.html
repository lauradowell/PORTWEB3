            <p><i>2024 - 
                Cardboard,
                Arduino,
                RFID reader and tags, 3D printed cover.
                30 x 17 x  4cm</i></p>

            <p>This custom-made book, featuring hand-drawn illustrations, works with an RFID reader to trigger story changes based on the child’s choices. Powered by Python, an Arduino, and the GPT API, the story gets a fun twist with each interaction, with Nana or other characters saying something new through the speaker, thanks to ElevenLabs voice design.</p>
            <p>When used solo, it offers a new twist to the adventure each time, keeping children engaged with the toy. When enjoyed with parents or guardians, both can decide Nana’s next move. Nana serves as a placeholder story, demonstrating a concept that can easily be adapted to various educational themes or different contexts. Kids stay engaged with prompts and at one point even get to draw their choice on a whiteboard.</p>

            <p>I started by 3d printing the cover for
                the RFID tag reader. I designed it in
                blender and sent it to a Prusa printer.
                I hand-cut the shape of the cover on
                each individual page. If I had had
                access to the laser cutter I would have
                used it, but in this case, I used a cutter. I
                also painted the pages white in case
                any colors showed through the pages.
                I then setup the RFID tag reader on
                the Arduino and worked on the code
                to send the data to the python
                sketch.</p>

                <img src="../process2/nanap2.png" alt="Process 4">
                <p>I hand drew the story board
                    and wrote the narrative for
                    the story. Here is where I
                    organised and planned what I
                    needed to draw. I hand drew the storyboard images using
                    Indian Ink and card. I then scanned these
                    drawings to later re-print with the narrative. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="process-item">
                <img src="../process2/nanap3.png" alt="Process 5">
                <p>I printed the drawings to
                    see how they would look,
                    and so I could measure the
                    dimensions to fit the cut
                    book.
                    After scanning the images
                    and measuring the
                    dimensions, I edited them
                    in photoshop and added
                    the narrative.
                    After editing the drawing I
                    pritned them in A3 so I could
                    cut them and stick them to
                    the book. I also cut the hole
                    for the RFID tag reader.
                    After sticking the final
                    images to the book, I set up
                    an improvised studio with a
                    tripod to film the book
                    interactivity in action.</p>
