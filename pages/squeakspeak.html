            <p><i>2023 - Arduino, LED strip, Felt, 3-D printed mice, arcade buttons, 150 x 100 x 15cm</i></p>
            <p>“SqueakSpeak” is a prototype toy for children featuring two robot mice and an interactive rug. Each mouse speaks a different language to promote social engagement and has a unique personality. The toy includes interchangeable maps on the rug to allow exploration. This project marked the beginning of my passion for educational technologies, a theme that continues to influence my work. The detailed design and development journey is presented below, emphasizing the process of ideation, prototyping, and refinement.</p>

            <h2>Creative Process</h2>

            <!-- Process Steps: One after the other -->
            <div class="process-item">
                <img src="../process/process1.png" alt="Process 1">
                <p>My creative process starts with grounding an initial idea through having conversations with other people. Once defined, I sketch the concept and use photoshop to make a mockup.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="process-item">
                <img src="../process/process2.png" alt="Process 2">
                <p>To find inspiration, I go to museums, read research papers, search the internet, make idea boards, etc. In this case, I was inspired by the original mouse design by Douglas Engelbart at the Science Museum to design
                    the 3D printed toy mice.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="process-item">
                <img src="../process/process3.png" alt="Process 3">
                <p>The mice were ideated to have rgb sensors underneath to calculate what position of the alphabet they were on by counting how many times it passed a color. Connected by reversible zippers, the rug allows special characters to be added for different language configurations. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="process-item">
                <img src="../process/process4.png" alt="Process 4">
                <p>After visiting the fabric library at Central Saint Martins, I chose felt as the main material and a plastic fabric for the letters. The contrast in texture was designed to make the tactile experience distinct and accessible for visually impaired children.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="process-item">
                <img src="../process/process5.png" alt="Process 5">
                <p>To create the alphabet ring, I printed it on paper at the desired size and used this as a stencil. Reversible zippers were used for the demonstration, while more affordable standard zippers were used for the rest.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="process-item">
                <img src="../process/process6.png" alt="Process 6">
                <p>I painted a watercolour map, scanned it, and printed it using a UV printer onto stiffened felt. This material allows the map to be easily changed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="process-item">
                <img src="../process/process7.png" alt="Process 7">
                <p>Now it was time to sew everything together, with the help of my grandma, we both hand-sewed, and used the sewing machine.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="process-item">
                <img src="../process/process8.png" alt="Process 8">
                <p>The Arduino sketch was straightforward, controlling LED lights to illuminate the letters of the word being spelled. Afterward, I designed some packaging for demonstration purposes and filmed it with the wonderful Kate.</p>
